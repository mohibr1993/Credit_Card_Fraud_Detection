## Project Overview

Welcome to the  Credit Card Fraud Detector project!

In today's digital age, credit card fraud has become an increasingly prevalent threat, costing both individuals and businesses billions of dollars annually. The goal of our project is to tackle this issue by developing an advanced credit card fraud detection system that operates proactively, identifying potential fraud patterns before they escalate into significant financial losses.


**Key Features**
- **Proactive Detection**: Unlike traditional fraud detection systems that often flag transactions after the fact, our solution aims to identify suspicious activities in real-time, enabling swift intervention and prevention.

- **Machine Learning and AI Power**: Leveraging the capabilities of machine learning algorithms, we're able to analyze complex patterns and anomalies within large-scale transaction datasets, improving the accuracy of our fraud detection.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Our user interface provides an intuitive dashboard that allows users to monitor transactions, view alerts, and access comprehensive reports, making it easy to manage and respond to potential threats.


**Objectives**
- **Enhanced Security**: By identifying and stopping fraudulent activities in their early stages, we aim to provide enhanced security for both individuals and businesses, reducing financial losses and increasing trust in financial systems.

- **Educational Resource**: This project also serves as an educational resource for aspiring data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. The accompanying documentation and codebase offer insights into implementing real-world fraud detection solutions.

- **Community Collaboration**: We encourage collaboration from the open-source community to improve the effectiveness of our fraud detection model. We believe that by working together, we can stay one step ahead of evolving fraud tactics.

Whether you're an individual concerned about the safety of your financial transactions or a developer interested in learning about machine learning and fraud detection, our Proactive Credit Card Fraud Detector project aims to provide valuable insights and tools to address the challenges posed by credit card fraud.



## Installation

Getting started with the  Credit Card Fraud Detector is straightforward. Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
example : `pip install numpy`

### Clone the Repository

command line : 

- git clone https://github.com/mohibr1993/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git

- cd Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

### Install Dependencies



Install the required Python packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
The project relies on various external libraries for its functionality. Here are some of the key libraries you'll be using:

- numpy: A library for numerical operations and linear algebra.
- pandas: A library for data processing and analysis, including CSV file I/O.
- tensorflow: A machine learning framework for building and training models.
- matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
- seaborn: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing additional aesthetics.
- sklearn: The scikit-learn library provides various machine learning algorithms and tools.
- imblearn: A library for handling imbalanced datasets, including resampling techniques.

## Dataset Source and Description
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card holders from Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Link : [https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/defaultof-credit-cardclients-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

Update (03/05/2021)
A simulator for transaction data has been released as part of the practical handbook on Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection - https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html. We invite all practitioners interested in fraud detection datasets to also check out this data simulator, and the methodologies for credit card fraud detection presented in the book.
